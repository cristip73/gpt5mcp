# Task: Explain Docker in 3 sentences

## Full Output
Docker is a platform for building, packaging, and running applications in lightweight, isolated containers. Containers bundle an app and its dependencies into an image that runs consistently across environments, sharing the host OS kernel instead of requiring a full virtual machine. This enables fast startup, efficient resource use, reproducible deployments, and easy scaling.
